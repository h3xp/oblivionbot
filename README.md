# oblivionbot

Simple discord bot I created for a video games guild that can interact with [eqdkp](https://eqdkpplus.github.io/) and displays [raid resets](https://www.classicraidreset.com/calendar) for easier raid management.

This repository is archived because the bot is outdated and only purposes documentary reasons.
